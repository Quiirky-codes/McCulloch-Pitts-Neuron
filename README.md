# Overview
The McCulloch-Pitts Neuron is a simple model of a biological neuron that can be used to implement basic logic gates. 
This implementation provides neurons for OR, AND, and XOR gates. The neurons are trained using a simple learning algorithm with adjustable learning rates and epochs.

# Parameters
* threshold: The threshold value for the neuron.
* learning_rate: The learning rate for the training algorithm.
* epochs: The number of epochs for training the neuron.
